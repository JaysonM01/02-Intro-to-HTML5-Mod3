          <p>My name is Jayson Malicse, but you can call me Jay. I lived in Laguna, Philippines and currently working in the neighboring province. I was a SMT (Suface Mounting Technology) Maintenance Engineer in my previous years and now, I am transitioning to a Junior Software Development Engineer. Although I'm still using tools and maintaining the functionality and quality of the system, the difference was I was using physical tools and machines(or hardwares) and now I'm using software tools and applications. It's a huge step but it felt good because I like coding.</p>
          <p>Now, I am learning the basics needed by a Software Development Engineer. It was a little bit confusing but I can keep up with the subjects because I do have a little background and understand some of the terms and how do they function.</p>
          <p>I know I've been talking about the work, but it has been a huge breakthrough for me and wanted to share it. Don't worry! I will also be sharing some of my experience, and maybe some of the things I learned about coding.</p>

        <h1>Traveling to Places</h1>
        <p>As I have worked abroad, specifically in Hungary, I had an opportunity to travel to other countries in Europe. I'll share you what I have experienced there.</p>

            A beautiful city known for the Eiffel Tower, <span class="province">Paris,</span> <span class="country">France</span> was an amazing trip even though it was raining most of the day. The view at the top was very breathtaking. We were lucky to experience it without rain in the afternoon and saw the beauty of the Eiffel Tower at night, where the lights are on. We have visited a lot of places there. Louvre Museum was huge and a lot of paintings and sculptures were there. We even saw the painting of MonaLisa. It was fine since I was not very interested to much details but the other arts, sculptures, and statues there really amazed me. (chapel and the stairs)

            I was able to travel to different places in Hungary as I was working here for a few years. Famous for its thermal baths and stunning architecture, Hungary offers a lot of tourist sites with breathtaking view. One of the great these place is the old fortress Citadel in Gellért Hill, <span class="province">Budapest</span>, <span class="country">Hungary</span>. You can view the Danube River, the famous chain bridge(Széchenyi Lánchíd), and Parliament building(Országház). There are many places to visit there, which includes the Heroe's Square, the Vajdahunyad Castle, and the lake in between them. You can go boating or paddle boating in it during Spring, Summer, and early Winter and turns into the largest ice-skating rink on late Autumn and Winter. Located in the southwest of the budapest lies the largest Lake, the Lake Balaton.
